If #include <stdio.h> is removed from a program that uses printf, the compiler does not know the function prototype for printf.

The stage that fails is the compilation stage.

The compiler will typically show a warning or error like:"warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’"
or "undefined reference to `printf`"

This happens because stdio.h contains the declaration for printf, and without it, the compiler cannot verify its usage.
