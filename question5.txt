The bug is in the scanf statement. The variable n is missing the & (address-of operator). scanf needs the memory address of the variable, not the variable itself.

Error type: Runtime error. The program compiles, but it will crash or behave incorrectly when scanf tries to write to an invalid location.

Corrected code uses: scanf("%d", &n);
