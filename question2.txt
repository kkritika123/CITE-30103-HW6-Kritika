Steps how C program moves from source code to execution.
1. Preprocessing
   - The preprocessor handles lines that start with #, like #include and #define.
     It copies code from header files (like stdio.h) into your program and replaces macros.
   - Example error:
     If you write  #include <stdoi.h>  (spelling mistake),
     the preprocessor cannot find this file and you get an error like:
     "fatal error: stdoi.h: No such file or directory".

2. Compilation
   - The compiler takes the preprocessed C code and checks the syntax and types.
     It then turns it into assembly code.
   - Example error:
     If you forget a semicolon, like:
       int x = 10
     the compiler may show:
       "error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’".

3. Assembly
   - The assembler turns the assembly code into machine code (an object file, such as .o).
   - Example error:
     Normally the compiler makes valid assembly, but if something is wrong,
     the assembler could say there is an "invalid instruction" or "syntax error"
     in the assembly file.

4. Linking
   - The linker combines your object file(s) with libraries (for example, the C standard
     library that has printf, scanf, etc.) to create one final executable program.
   - Example error:
     If you call a function but there is no definition for it when linking,
     you might see:
       "undefined reference to `myFunction`".

5. Loading (and execution)
   - The operating system loads the executable from disk into memory and then starts it.
   - Example error:
     If the file is missing or you do not have permission, you may see:
       "No such file or directory" or "Permission denied" when trying to run it.
