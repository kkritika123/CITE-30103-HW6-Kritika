There are three identifier (variable name) errors:

1. int 1value = 10;
   Error: A variable name cannot start with a number.
   Fix: int value1 = 10;

2. float avg-rate = 12.5;
   Error: A variable name cannot have a minus sign (-). Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed.
   Fix: float avg_rate = 12.5;

3. char Class = 'A';
   Error: Variable names should not look like keywords or built-in names. Using "Class" can be confusing.
   Fix: char classGrade = 'A';

Rules:
- Variable names cannot start with numbers.
- They cannot contain symbols like -.
- Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed.
